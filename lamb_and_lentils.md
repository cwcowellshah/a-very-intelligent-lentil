# Lamb and Lentil Stew

Rough peasant food that's low effort and delicious

## Ingredients

* Two lamb shanks, or two lamb shoulder chops (cut up) or a pound of bone-in lamb shoulder
* One large onion, diced
* 1/2 pound peeled, roughly chopped carrots
* 1 and 1/2 cups any kind of lentils
* 3 fat garlic cloves, smashed, peeled, and roughly chopped
* 3/4 tsp dried powdered rosemary, or a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh rosemary
* olive oil
* (optional) 1/2 cup red wine
* (optional) 1 beef or lamb bouillon cube

## Instructions

1. Heat a dutch oven or heavy-bottomed large saucepan with 2 Tb olive oil until it's smoking, and brown the lamb on all sides, in batches if necessary. Remove the lamb from the pan.
2. Saute the vegetables, including the garlic, for 3 or 4 minutes. 
3. Rinse the lentils and add them to the pan.
4. Add liquid to cover by an inch and a half. Add the wine if you're using it, and the rosemary, and continue heating until boiling.
5. Add the bouillon cube if you're using it.
6. Cover the pan, turn it down, and simmer for two hours. Salt and pepper to taste, adding more rosemary if you like. At this point, the lentils should be soft and the meat should be beginning to shred from the bones; if it isn't, continue cooking for another 30-60 minutes.
7. Pull as much meat off the bones as you easily can, and stir it into the rest of the stew. 
8. Serve over steamed rice with a nice simple green vegetable on the side.
